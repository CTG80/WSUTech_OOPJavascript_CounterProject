# WSUTech_OOPJavascript_CounterProject
Module 2 Project

Create a program that displays a counter on an HTML page. 

Your counter should start at zero and contain buttons that add to and subract from the total count every time it is clicked. 
The total count should be displayed on the page and should also update when the count changes.

Use comments in your script to describe what the major functions of the code are doing.
